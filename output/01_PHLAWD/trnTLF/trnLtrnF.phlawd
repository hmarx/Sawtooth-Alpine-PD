# there are 14 matching seqs for A. trichomanes on gb. used POE to find the one
# that was breaking phlawd, and put its GI number in the referenced exclude file.
# the other matching GI numbers are in the exclude file too, but commented out.
# things seem to be working ok now. I checked the bad seq on GB and it doesn't
# look bad; there don't seem to be weird characters in the 11 positions from
# either end, so I don't know what the deal is. I recommend just using this
# exclude file (only relevant for this particular run). I will talk to Stephen
# and see what he has to say about the error. Seems like it would be best to
# have phlawd spit out a GI number when it chokes on an input sequence to save
# the hassle of tracking it down.
